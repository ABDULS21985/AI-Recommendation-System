# AI-Powered Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is an AI-Powered Recommendation System designed for e-commerce, entertainment, and content platforms. The system delivers personalized recommendations based on user behavior, interactions, and preferences using advanced recommendation algorithms.

## Features

- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering and other algorithms.
- **Item Management**: Supports CRUD operations for items with metadata (e.g., price, color).
- **User Interactions**: Logs user interactions such as views, likes, and ratings.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email notifications with recommended items based on user preferences.
- **User Preferences**: Manages user notification preferences (e.g., frequency of email notifications).
- **Search and Filtering**: Allows search and filtering of items by title, description, price, and color.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination for large datasets in item retrieval.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture with a modular design, separating concerns between recommendations, notifications, user interactions, and item management.

### Key Modules:
- **Recommendation Module**: Handles the recommendation engine and logic.
- **Notification Module**: Manages email notifications and user preferences for frequency.
- **User Interaction Module**: Logs and tracks user interactions like views, ratings, and likes.
- **Item Module**: Manages items with metadata (e.g., price, color).

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer (or equivalent)
- **Scheduling**: NestJS Scheduler (for Cron jobs)
- **Recommendation Engine**: Collaborative filtering and other algorithms
- **API Documentation**: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
- **Logging**: Built-in NestJS Logger

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x

Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Recommendation-System.git
cd AI-Recommendation-System
Install dependencies:


## yarn install
Generate Prisma client:


## yarn prisma generate

## Usage
## User Management
Create User: POST /users - Add a new user.
Get User by ID: GET /users/:id - Retrieve user details by ID.
Get All Users: GET /users - List all users.

## Item Management
Create Item: POST /items - Add a new item with metadata.
Get Items: GET /items - Retrieve items with support for search, filtering, and pagination.

## User Interactions
Log Interaction: POST /interactions - Log a user interaction (view, click, like, rating).
Get User Interactions: GET /interactions/:userId - Get all interactions for a specific user.

## Recommendations
Get Recommendations: GET /recommendations/:userId - Get personalized recommendations for a user.
Generate Recommendations: GET /recommendations/generate/:userId - Generate and save recommendations for a user.

## Email Notifications
Email Frequency: User preferences for receiving email recommendations (daily/weekly) are stored and respected when sending notifications.

## Testing
Running Unit Tests
The application includes unit tests for services and controllers. To run the tests:


##yarn test

##Logging and Monitoring
Logging: The application uses NestJS's built-in logger for tracking requests, errors, and events.
Monitoring: The application includes basic monitoring for scheduled Cron jobs and email notifications.

##Future Enhancements
Advanced Recommendation Algorithms: Introduce machine learning models for better personalization.
Real-Time Notifications: Implement real-time push notifications for user recommendations.
Admin Panel: Create an admin interface for managing items, users, and interactions.
